LOGO UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Please save the blue gear with car logo image as:
- c:\Users\USER\Desktop\carpartmarket\mechanic_part\web-nextjs\public\logo.png (512x512 PNG)
- c:\Users\USER\Desktop\carpartmarket\mechanic_part\web-nextjs\app\favicon.ico (convert to ICO format)

The logo has been referenced in the codebase and will display once you add these files.

You can use online tools like:
- https://convertio.co/png-ico/ to convert PNG to ICO
- Or use any image editing software to create the favicon.ico file
